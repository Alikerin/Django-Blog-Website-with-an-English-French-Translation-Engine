I proceeded to Federal Polytechnic Nasarawa for my national youth service during which I authored a book titled "Introduction to Programming with Scratch". The book is a beginner's guide to computing from the perspective of how the computer operates underneath the hood. Inspiration to author the book came during when I was teaching kids computer programming: an initiative of Exabytes Tech Academy. The mission of Exabytes Tech Academy is to spawn a young generation of computational thinkers across Africa whom will design and create with technology. As the founder of Exabytes Tech Academy, I have a vision of Africans contributing to technological development that makes the world a better place for everyone to live.</span><br></p><p style="text-align: center; "><span style="font-size: 18px;">After my youth service, I returned to my Alma mater as&nbsp; an assistant lecturer in the department of computer engineering where I assisted in teaching programming related courses to undergrads. I also served as a Python programming instructor at Cisco Academy, Ahmadu Bello University. In 2018 when I returned to my university, I began to develop interest in machine learning and in the same year I was selected for the 2018 Facebook PyTorch Scholarship Challenge, which jump-started my machine learning career.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: center; "><span style="font-size: 18px;">I am currently a student of the African Masters in Machine Intelligence (sponsored by Google and Facebook) at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Rwanda. Having been taught by some of the best researchers in the field of machine/deep learning, I am leaving no stone unturned as I journey my way to becoming a renowned machine learning researcher. I have interests in Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. And lately, I fell in love with NLP after taking an NLP course.
